# AI Co-Pilot

Amplifying creativity inside Beefree/RGE Studio

# AI is becoming the baseline

<div>

From **Stensul** to **Knak**, from **Stripo** to **ActiveCampaign**,  
the message is the same: *"Give us a prompt. We'll generate your campaign."*

- Full emails
- Layouts + copy
- Even automation logic

<div class="mt-8">

**But is speed alone enough?**

# Speed without control is not the future

Distributed teams working across complex stacks do not just want automation. They care about:

- **Brand integrity**
- **Accessibility**
- **Clean, stable HTML**
- **Control**

<div class="mt-8">

> The real question is: What does responsible, reliable AI look like inside the tools professionals trust every day?

</div>

# Assistive. Not autonomous.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 300px; gap: 2rem; align-items: center;">

<div>

Our AI Co-Pilot does not replace humans, but it is:

- An **assistant**
- A **co-creator**
- A **force multiplier** for human creativity

<div class="mt-8 text-xl">

An **intelligent design partner**!

# AI Co-Pilot in Beefree/RGE Studio

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 300px; gap: 2rem; align-items: center;">

The customer brings:
- The **idea**
- The **brief**
- The **brand**

<div class="mt-8">

The AI Co-Pilot helps turn that into a full, stable, on-brand email inside the design environment they already trust.

# The challenges we faced

1. **Consistency**: Tools get called correctly, but not consistently. <br/>Use blue in row 1, red in row 2, blue again in row 3.
2. **Probabilistic execution**: Just because you ask for something in a prompt doesn't guarantee it happens 100% of the time. LLMs are non-deterministic by nature.
3. **Prompt engineering**: Every line you add to the system prompt competes with every line already there. By adding you dilute.
4. **Evaluating correctness**: You can't unit test an agent. Knowing if it's doing a good job is non-trivial.
5. **LLMs know HTML, CSS, Python, React** and other common languages fluently. 
On the other hand **LLMs don't know Beefree custom JSON format** or our specific **MCP toolset**.


> Our email JSON format is harder to work with but it's **why our emails render correctly on many email clients**.

---

# How we solved them

**The key insight:** Separate planning from execution.

1. **Planner creates a structured plan**: Instead of letting the agent call tools directly, we ask it to generate a detailed plan in a predefined JSON format.

2. **Executor runs the plan deterministically**: Tool calls are no longer made by the agent. The executor reads the plan and programmatically calls the right tools in the right sequence.

<div class="mt-8">

> By moving tool calls out of the agent's hands, we turned an unreliable process into a predictable one.

</div>

# Lessons Learned

1. **A structured plan is likely one key to good results.**  
   A tight output schema changes everything.

2. **Less AI is sometimes the right call.**  
   Deterministic beats autonomous when you need reliability.

3. **Prompt engineering is never done, and addition is the enemy.**  
   Every edge case someone wants to fix with a new line. Resist it.

# What's Next

Some of the next steps we are excited about:

- **Parallelizing the planner**  
  Split into an orchestrator + N parallel section planners. Faster, and better at complex multi-section emails.

- **UX refinements**  
  Better feedback loops: revert actions, loading states, and smoother editing experience.

- **Personalized context**  
  Smart copy suggestions and learning from your patterns: styles, templates, and workflows you use most.

- **Hackaton: Fine-tuning open source LLM on our toolset**  
  Instead of teaching the LLM our JSON through prompts, train it to speak our MCP tools natively.
